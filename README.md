## Getting Started with Dev Containers

1. Get set up with Visual Studio Code insiders, Docker and remote extensions [instructions here](https://vscode-docs-remote.azurewebsites.net/docs/remote/remote-overview#_getting-started)

1. If on windows, set git to use LF line endings: 
    ```
    git config --global core.autocrlf false
    ```
1. Clone repo 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/python-sample-tweeterapp
    ```
1. From Visual Studio Code Insiders, run the ```Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...``` and select the ```python-sample-tweeterapp``` folder

After the dev container has installed and files appear in the explorer, you are good to go!

## Run some code!


Build the node front end by opening a new terminal with ```Ctrl-Shift-` ```, and running:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```


Start the Django server by opening a new terminal (```Ctrl-Shift-` ```), and running:
